# This is the latest version that changes the coordinate transform matrix.
# ID Matrix       Transform Matrix    Result           Result Expanded
# [ 1, 0, 0 ]	  [ .75,   0, 0 ]	  [ .75 ]          [ .75,   0, 0 ]
# [ 0, 1, 0 ]	* [   0, .75, 0 ]	= [ .75 ]  ( AKA ) [   0, .75, 0 ]
# [ 0, 0, 1 ]	  [   0,   0, 1 ]	  [  1  ]          [   0,   0, 1 ]
# This reduces the scale of the mapping between the input, and the resulting cursor movement.
# Right now we reduce to 75%.
